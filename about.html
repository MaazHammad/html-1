        <p>Assalam-o-Alaikum</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? (Surat Bagers, Verse 245)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, intills upon his men to give Qara-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth Allah speaks about qarz because it is entured and Allah promines that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad promptmg Muslims to spend the wealth in a certain way. He says, Oh childrm of Adam! Trust me with your wealth If you do sa, no fire, flood or this will be able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their mamey on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly On t Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated t ated because they did not help the needy The needy will complam to Allah and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use, they were huiy spending on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who needed it Allah will reply to this and say: "I swear on my respect and glory! I wall bring you closer to me and pash them further away</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded Saylan Welfare with the highest favor by sending those people our way who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, gave zakat, fidyah, finah, khairat and other donations to help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of Judgment</p>
